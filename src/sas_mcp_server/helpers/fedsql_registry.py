"""Static vocabularies for the FedSQL ``query_data`` tool.

Ported from sassoftware/sas-mcp-server. The frozen data that drives ``fedsql_helpers.py``, kept apart from the functions
so each table can be read, audited, and extended on its own:

* the screening patterns — what a submitted statement must look like, and the
  masks that let the structural checks ignore comments and literals;
* :data:`WRITE_VERBS` / :data:`WRITE_VERB_RE` — the statement verbs this tool
  refuses, and :data:`RESERVED_WORDS`, used to sharpen a syntax error with the
  "double-quote it" remedy;
* the SAS format-name prefixes that mark a numeric column as a date, datetime,
  or time serial, plus the epoch those serials count from;
* :data:`ERROR_RULES` — the log-line → (status, remediation) table that turns a
  raw FedSQL failure into something a model can act on, and :data:`ERROR_NOISE`,
  the trailing lines every failure appends.

Data only — anything that executes lives in ``fedsql_helpers.py``. Adding a
dialect fact (a new reserved word, another date format, one more error the
service emits) is a one-line edit here that the screen, the result shaping, and
the error mapping all pick up.

# NOTE (live-verified): PROC FEDSQL does NOT honour a libref's
# ``access=readonly``. A DATA step writing to such a libref is denied ("Write
# access to member ... is denied"), but FedSQL's BASE driver talks to the
# underlying directory and happily runs CREATE TABLE, UPDATE, DELETE and DROP
# against it. So there is no library-level backstop behind this screen: on the
# compute tier the screen is the *only* thing standing between a submitted
# statement and a write. (CAS is different — caslib access is enforced by Viya
# authorisation against the caller's identity, which FedSQL cannot bypass.)
